        <h2>The Legacy Continues: Jaime Bennington</h2>
        <p>2020 was a hard year for music and that is a known fact. Although, there were some good things that happened
          in 2020.</p>
        <p><img class="alignright" src="images/art12.gif" width="200" height="150" alt="" /></p>
        <p>In 2020, we had the chance to hear remastered Grey Daze songs featuring the one and only Chester Bennington
          on their album “Amends” and to see their amazing video of “Soul Song”, directed by Jaime Bennington, Chester’s
          son, that already has no less than 2.2 million views on YouTube.</p>
        <p>Moreover, in 2020, Jaime released his first EP “Then”, in which he describes himself and his life.</p>
        <p>After such a successful year, we had the pleasure to talk to Jaime about his achievements and, of course, his
          future plans in an exclusive interview for our publication!</p>
        <p>Can you describe “music” in one word? Why did you choose it?</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>If I had to describe the term music in one word I would use the equally ambiguous term of manipulation. I
            choose the word manipulation to convey the meaning of music because all music is the product of a
            manipulation. Of matter, of mind, of spirit. When these three elements are combined in a unique way with the
            precision of knowing and of the precision of intention they produce a near-perfect portrait of something
            unseen within the Self so that it can, in fact, be seen. Everything about the Self is manipulated in some
            form or fashion from the moment we are born, and more often than not, from as early on as our time in the
            womb. Whether that interaction (or manipulation) is ‘good’ or ‘bad’ is rooted in the interpretation of that
            interaction by the Observer, and so, the term manipulation, as I use it to describe music, proves to be the
            most liberating descriptor for not just music but any art seeing as though the taste of an individual is
            completely relative to their experience. A constantly evolving process of data integration that never stops
            until you die, and even then continues.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In 2020 you released your EP, “Then”, but you also collaborated with Grey Daze on “Amends”. How were these
          projects influenced by the pandemic?</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>I wouldn’t say that the pandemic had any influence whatsoever on these two projects. Amends was a project
            that I helped with before the pandemic, and though, while I released my EP THEN during the pandemic, it was
            only a coincidence. THEN was something I had been working on for a long time. For the better half of three
            years. And was actually intended to be two separate albums derived from two totally unique visions I had for
            myself: a whimsical post-modern take on the more playful parts of my Self and the more grounded and heady
            recollection of my life from birth until about two years ago. It was only after I admitted to myself that
            producing two albums while kickstarting the film career I was working hard to kick off that I would have to
            combine the two projects and move on with my life. Which is not something I am particularly bothered by,
            because I don’t think there is such a thing as a ‘crowning achievement.’ Trust me I have plenty of ideas,
            more ideas than I have projects to support. As long as I am working on myself there is no shortage of
            content, no missed opportunities. If the motivation to make an album returns to me, which it has on multiple
            occasions, then that work will be there for me in the future. There is no rush whatsoever.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>How did it feel to collaborate with Grey Daze? Were you proud of the final version of the EP?</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Collaborating with Sean, Esjay, and the rest of the guys behind Grey Daze was a blast. It might sound
            cliché to say that they are all great people, but it’s true. I experienced nothing but fun while I was
            recording for ‘Soul Song’ and I experienced nothing but total freedom in my production of the music video
            for the ‘Soul Song.’ What I did with that video was kind of ridiculous if you ask me. But nobody stopped me.
            All I got was a thumbs up and a big Green Light. To be honest, that video was probably more satisfying to me
            than tracking vocals for the song because I got to work on something that brought all of my art to a single
            place. That is something I am extremely grateful for. I somehow managed to produce a spiritual work for a
            rock album. A work that received high praise from the fans, of both LP and Grey Daze, and has since reached
            2.2 million views on YouTube alone, which is beyond amazing to say the least. That’s the kind of stuff that
            you laugh about on your own time saying, “This thing is going to do really well. Maybe like a million
            views.” And then let be. Mostly the comment is sarcastic and more geared towards poking fun at myself for
            thinking that it would ever reach that height let alone a greater height. The implication is that it
            wouldn’t ever happen. But it did! How great is that?</p>
